<p>Automated cloud services can sometimes lead to scenarios where copies of files are automatically made with different names.</p>

<p>These redundant files take up space, and it can be daunting to have to sort these files out for manual pruning after months of this (or longer). In my case, I have my phone auto-uploading to dropbox, and this means I have nicely named files in my dropbox account, but a lot of DCIM_ files on my phone that are likely duplicates of the dropbox files, but not always. Phones get full, and those files need to be purged after awhile, but simply deleting those all videos and photos on my phone seems scary. So I wrote this tool for peace of mind to make sure that what I'm deleting from my phone is actually something that exists somewhere else.</p>
