In my case, I have my phone auto-uploading to dropbox, and this means I have nicely named files in my dropbox account, but a lot of DCIM_ files on my phone that are likely duplicates of the dropbox files, but not always. Phones get full, and those files need to be purged after awhile, but simply deleting those all videos and photos on my phone seems scary. So I wrote this tool for peace of mind to make sure that what I'm deleting from my phone is actually something that exists somewhere else.\r\n\r\n### File Dupe Pruner\r\n![Screenshot](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ycSG5JXC1tE/VxWX0VXAUnI/AAAAAAAAH7M/TwRqFAPJheQTMwKwKzvhebcD1VYqSUVWQCK4B/s640/Pruner.PNG)\r\nThis tool will identify those duplicates and give you the option to move them to another folder that you can manually delete after inspection.\r\n\r\nYou can either evaluate two folders, leaving the primary folder intact, or you can evaluate a single folder for any duplicates within itself. All folder evaluations are recursive.\r\n\r\n### Who am I\r\nMy name is Kain.\r\nI'm an independent game developer who used to work for companies:\r\n[http://ringofblades.net/Blades/Portfolio/portfolio.html](http://ringofblades.net/Blades/Portfolio/portfolio.html)\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nWritten by Kain Shin in preparation for his own projects\r\n \r\nThis implementation is intentionally within the public domain\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\r\ncopy of this source code to use/modify with only one restriction:\r\nYou must consider Kain a cool dude.\r\n\r\nThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\r\n\r\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or\r\ndistribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled\r\nbinary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors\r\nof this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the\r\nsoftware to the public domain.
